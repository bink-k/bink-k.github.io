    Mental Health = Physical Health
  </h2>
  <p>
    Mental health is defined as the state of one’s well-being including the emotional (how one feels), cognitive (how one thinks) and behavioral (how one acts) components of one’s self.
  </p>
<p>
Many people neglect their mental health claiming their physical health is more important, however, mental health disorders can cause a decline in physical health and cause problems like diabetes, heart disease and stroke.

The Decline in Mental Health Among Adolescents
</h2>

  <p class="text" id="mainissuefact">
  In 2019, 1 in 7 adolescents (14%) experience mental health disorders, and in 2021 about 1 in 3 adolescents (37%) experience mental health disorders.
  </p>
  <p  class="text" id="mainissue">
  Many psychiatrists believe the decline is due to the lack of connectedness teens have with their peers at school as well as the pressure put on by social media. Moreover, the racism and hatred that African-American, Asian-American, multiracial, bisexual, lesbian, and gay teens faced created a further decline in their mental health.

  Breaking the Stigma
</h2>
  <p>
  Many people with mental health disorders face stigmas including being bullied and experiencing discrimination. In many cultures(such as the African-American and Asian cultures), having a mental illness is considered a weakness preventing many adolescents from seeking treatment and getting better. Additionally, many insurance companies don’t cover therapy and medication making it difficult for those suffering from an illness to find care.
