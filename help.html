<!--Implementing a Program Section-->
<h4>Implement a Program</h4>
<p>Start a program at the local high school that creates a safe space for teenagers to talk about how they’re feeling mentally and makes it easier for them to seek help if needed.</p>
<!-- Encouraging teens-->
<h4>Encourage teens to seek treatment</h4>
<p>If you notice a teen in your life acting differently and believe they have issues with their mental health, encourage them to see a doctor or a therapist. Ensure that they feel supported and they don’t feel alone.</p>
